**IMPORTANT**: This update brings the changes from melonDS 0.9.3, which has incompatible saves-states with the previous version. If you rely on save-states to keep your
progress, be aware that you will lose your progress! 

**Changelog:**
* Update to melonDS 0.9.3
* Add support for Rewind. This automatically saves your state periodically allowing you to quickly go back in time when you make a mistake in a game
* Include screenshots in save states
* Allow save states to be deleted
* Add buttons to quickly save and load a state (not present in the default layout)
* Redesign Settings screen. Each category is now grouped into a separate screen
* Add volume setting
* Add audio latency setting
* Prevent ZIP files from being selected as the ROM search directory (only happened on some devices)
* Add Russian translation (thanks @6lackmag3)
* Other minor fixes and improvements
